Implementation for Task C for a 2D-Array
Declare size of 2D-array by manually entering in values or given dimensions. Ex: [4][4]. 4 rows, 4 columns
Add integers in a 2D-array
Remove integers in a 2D-array
Each integer will have a position based off of its row and column [i][j]
Set a value at a certain position
Get a value at a certain position
getRow: Get a specific row of a 2D-array
getColumn: Get a specific column of a 2D-array
deleteRow: Delete a specific row of a 2D-array
deleteColumn: Delete a specific column of a 2D-array
setRow: Get a specific row of a 2D-array
setColumn: set a specific column of a 2D-array
This should be a sufficient list of possibilites of what to do with a 2-D array.
