Problem Set 7 README C343 Fall 2020 Aaron Lack, alack
Take a screenshot of your graphical output.
Describe how you designed and implemented your Java classes for Problem Set 07.

I made my problem set model class from re-using a lot of code from PS06 and PS05. I made the d and e arrays
global and made height and width instance variables, just like last time. Created a constructor to pass in the
width and height. My distance function stayed relatively the same, except I added comparisons for the
insertion, deletion, substitution, or nothing happening in the final for loop of the function. I extend the
observable class so I can notify my observers and return the min, and still get an edit distance of 6, just
like last problem set. My dLine and eLine methods I just return the distance function call of aString() and
bString(). aString() and bString() are just reading in the files, from my main function in the last problem
set.

My View class is different then my last problem set, partially because I messed it up last time. I extend
jComponent and implement actionEvent, and I put all of the necessary jFrame commands in the constructor. I
call this.repaint() in my actionEvent method, and set the background to white in the paintComponent method. My
draw point will do all of the work, I write multiple if statements to truncate rgb values that could be >255
or <0. I instantiate a graphics object and fill in a rectangle of size 1,1 to draw one point at a time. My
clear method is very similar to PS05, where I fill the whole background of color(127,127,127). Finally,
I make static arrays vowels and consonants to be used in boolean methods to check if the character in the
string is either a vowel or a consonant.

My Controller class is also more involved then last time. I instantiate a width, height, model, and view
objects and pass them into the controller constructor. I make sure to extend JFrame and implement actionevent
and observer, since I am painting some more and overidding the update method in this class. The
actionperformed and paintcomponent methods are the same as my view class. My update method does all of the
work. I first iterate through the aString() length and assign the corresponding colors to spaces, vowels, and
consonants, and special characters. I repeat this process for bString(). Then, I iterate through the e[][]
and assign corresponding values based on the insertion, deletion, substitution or no cost outcomes. I follow
similar logic for the d[][]. Finally in my main method, I make a new controller object and call it with the
dist method from the model class.

My graphical output (at the moment) is just a blank white screen, even though my logic and code seems sound.

I want to note that I have been waiting in office hours for this assignment on Tuesday from 10:45-11:30am,
3-4pm, and 6-730pm and have was not gotten to for asking questions about this assignment. This is very
concerning to me, because I really struggled in this problem set I feel I could have gotten a much better
grade if an someone help me for no more than 10 minutes. I just wanted to bring this to the AI's and Mitja's
attention because I think a lot of people feel the same way as well.
