Problem Set 4 C343 README
A few notes about Task A
I made an instance of Int2DArray and changed Mitja's starter code to pass in int[][] because that is how I implemented
that class in problem set 2.
I made some new methods: paint(), which given the rgb values assigns colors to that pixel based on the random numnber
generated.
display() to actually display the matrix.
randomArray() to fill the array up with random values, complimented with getRandomArray() to get the max and minvalues
in java.
Then in main, I call displayMatrix and and randomArrayMatrix with the Jframe code.
I got the matrix to show up, but since ware using the Java Max and Min values, the numbers ares super large and small
that generate, and the screen looks like a QR code since it is mostly black and white pixels.

A few notes about B:
With tree problems that I have done in the past, you need a helper function to do recursion on the actual function
because that is the most efficient way to implement them.
I use the compareTo method with the actual root value in the tree, if > 0 go right, < 0 go left because this follows the
patterns and rules of a binary tree.
I return true as an else statement and return false to satisfy the function, then call the helper function in the find
method.
In main, I construct a tree, see the comments of what I drew and I attach them to the nodes and set the values left and
right so that they are in order and the find method will return true. I also added some false cases on purpose to show
why it wouldn't work.
