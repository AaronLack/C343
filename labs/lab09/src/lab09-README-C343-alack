Aaron Lack alack C343 FA20 Lab 9 README File

In your plain-text README file, let us know what that "maximum working key" integer value is for your
implementation; also, you need to explain how you found that "maximum working key" integer value, above which
your implementation stops working.

My maximum working key should be 100, because I set the length of my intermediate array to size 100. For my
program to work, I made a randomize array method that fills values from 0-100. The maximum working key does
not work when I have a value greater than 100. I made a fail randomize array that fills up the array of values
0-300. A value greater than 100 means the length of the intermediate array will have to be larger than 100,
which causes an error in my program because I have the length of the intermediate array to 100. Since a value
greater than 100 requires more space in the intermediate array, my program crashes stating it is an index out
of bounds error for length 100, which is what we wanted.

I implemented the counting sort method based on the instructions in the given lab task, which I left in my
class. I also implemented a couple of randomize array methods and a find max element for testing purposes in
my main method. I have 5 working test cases, plus a 6th test case that fails on purpose. I have detailed
comments for what each line does, so I am keeping my descriptions for how I solved this problem vague in this
README.
