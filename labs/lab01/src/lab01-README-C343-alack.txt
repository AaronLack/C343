I made a counter/tracker variable to count the instruction counts for the given algorithms in example 2 and 7
Then I made instances of CalculateRunTimes in TheRunTimes to test my program and to see how many Instruction Counts
there are in each example.

Solutions:
Example 2: Size = 10  Instruction Counter = 211
Example 7: Size = 10  Instruction Counter = 411
Example 2: Size = 100  Instruction Counter = 20101
Example 7: Size = 100  Instruction Counter = 40101
Example 2: Size = 1000  Instruction Counter = 2001001
Example 7: Size = 1000  Instruction Counter = 4001001
