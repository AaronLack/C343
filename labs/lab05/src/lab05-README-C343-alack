I went to lab office hours and got help from Brendan, and we noticed the root for the BST is 1. This is odd because
following the bst properties, all of the child nodes will be placed to the right, never to the left of
the root. This  makes this tree more like a linked-list or array, which is ironic considering this is a lab about binary
 search trees. Nevertheless, I have all of my methods running and Brendan said my logic is sound for my implementations
 for the lab tasks.

Here are some resources I used to help me code and understand Task C to find the kth smallest element in a BST:
