I went to lab office hours and got help from Brendan, however we couldn't figure why not all the values in
the Integer[] ks were being built from the tree. The values 3,5,7, and 9 are missing. This lead to the preOrder and
InOrder methods returning the same path, even though they should be different. My guess is the way this starter code was
 set up, since one is the root, this really isn't a good example of a binary search tree, since all the elemtents are
 larger than one, so only rigth nodes are created, making this almost like an array. Nevertheless, I have all of my
 methods running and Brendan said my logic is sound for my implementations for the lab tasks.


Here are some resources I used to help me code and understand Task C to find the kth smallest element in a BST:
